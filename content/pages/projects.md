Summary: Some projects that I'm working on.

Here's a place to keep track of some projects that I'm currently working on, past and present.

# Current projects
* The [docathon](https://bids.github.io/docathon/) is a week-long hackathon centered around improving documentation in the open-source world.
* I'm working on an [introduction to data science in cognitive neuroscience](https://github.com/data-8/cogneuro-connector) class for undergraduates
* I'm writing a tutorial/methods paper along with [example jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/choldgraf/methods_encoding_model) on predictive models for cognitive neuroscience.
* I'm working to build an [open course in data science for neuroscience](https://github.com/neuro-data-science/neuro_data_science) to be a public repository of tutorials and how-tos on studying the brain.
