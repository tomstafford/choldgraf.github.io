# Predictably Noisy
This is repository where I'll store all the content used on my personal blog. It's a collection of jupyter notebooks / markdown files that cover topics ranging from computational neuroscience, to data science, to open science, and probably a lot of other stuff too.

A few of the notebooks have been created as interactive Binder files. To see which ones, just follow the binder link below and a notebook will open with links to ones that will work.

Science works better when it's free, open, and understandable. These are my goals in pushing content to this website, I hope you enjoy!
